## Introduction

* JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, but is now used in many other environments as well.

* Today, JavaScript has a unique position as the most widely-adopted browser language with full integration with HTML/CSS.

* There are many languages that get “transpiled” to JavaScript and provide certain features. It is recommended to take a look at them, at least briefly, after mastering JavaScript.

Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.

The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.

Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:

```
1. V8 – in Chrome and Opera.
2. SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.
3. There are other codenames like “Trident” and “Chakra” for different versions of IE, “ChakraCore” for Microsoft Edge, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
```

## Specifications
* JavaScript was originally named JavaScript in hopes of capitalizing on the success of Java.

* Netscape then submitted JavaScript to ECMA International for Standardization. (ECMA is an organization that standardizes information)
* This results in a new language standard, known as ECMAScript.
Put simply, ECMAScript is a standard. While JavaScript is the most popular implementation of that standard. JavaScript implements ECMAScript and builds on top of it.

## Okay, so ‘ES’…?


### ES5
December 2009: Nearly 10 years later, ES5 was released in 2009. It would then take almost six years for the next version of ECMAScript to be released.
### ES6 / ES2015
June 2015: Perhaps the cause for all of your confusion begins here. You see, ES6 and ES2015 are the same thing.

ES6 was the popularized name prior to release. However, the committee that oversees ECMAScript specifications made the decision to move to annual updates. With this change, the edition was renamed to ES 2015 to reflect the year of release. Subsequent releases will therefor also be named according to the year they are released.
### ES2016 (ES7)
June 2016: Seventh edition of ECMAScript.

### ES2017 (ES8)
June 2017: Eighth edition of ECMAScript.

### ES.Next
You may have also seen ES.Next used online. This term is dynamic and references the next version of ECMAScript coming out
